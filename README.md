A high-performance, multithreaded Java web server designed to handle concurrent client requests efficiently. This project demonstrates the implementation of a scalable web server capable of serving static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and handling multiple clients simultaneously using multithreading and thread pooling.

---

## **Features**
- **Multithreading**: Handles multiple client requests concurrently using threads.
- **Static File Serving**: Efficiently reads and delivers static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from the file system.
- **Thread Pooling**: Utilizes a thread pool to manage resources and improve scalability.
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeout for client connections to ensure optimal resource utilization.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle increasing client loads with minimal performance degradation.

---

## **Performance Improvements**
- **35% Improvement in Server Efficiency**: Optimized concurrent request handling and resource management.
- **Reduced Latency**: Improved responsiveness by efficiently serving static files and managing client connections.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Java 17**: Core programming language for server implementation.
- **Multithreading**: For handling concurrent client requests.
- **Socket Programming**: For client-server communication.
- **Thread Pooling**: For efficient resource management.
- **Static File Handling**: For serving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
